🏃‍♂️🚴‍♀️ Introducing Mapty: Track Your Workouts on the Map! 🗺️

Mapty is a JavaScript-based project that lets you visualize your running and cycling workouts on an interactive map. It uses the Geolocation API to fetch your current location and displays a map centered around you.

With Mapty, you can easily log your workouts, including details like distance, duration, and notes. All your data is stored in the browser's Local Storage, making it accessible across sessions.

Click on a workout in the list to automatically pan the map to its location. Each workout is marked on the map with a pointer, and clicking on it opens a customized textbox. You can quickly view workout specifics like average pace, calories burned, or average speed.

Mapty provides an intuitive interface, allowing you to navigate your workouts and toggle pointer visibility. Start using Mapty to track and visualize your fitness journey today!
